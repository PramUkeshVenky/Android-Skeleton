Create Android Project from Command Line Interface Hola!

I had seen many websites that show building apps from commandline interface with gradle support

but none say that how to create the project form cli so, every time when i want to create a project i have to open android studio doing blabla.... so, i had created a java file that accepts project name and package somemore like android studio and creates a project in gradle build-able project

Note : I dont know whether Already had created such project or studio create a project itself fron cli because i dont find any such if you know them please tell them to me

TODO: 
// If you find some meathod can be improved create an issue with solution i prefer improved code plus less bloat

usage

download jar and open with java -jar filename.jar Enter detailes Your project created i dont include gradlewrapper so copy wrapper file from other projects to this to root/gradle/wrapper/copy_here

If you have suggesion please give it to me i will defenately take that

if you find the code childish yeah i wrote every line of code by googling it because i don't much java

Also if you have time add simple gui- Graphical User Interface to this using swing of fx
report back your gui version to me
